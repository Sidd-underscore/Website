          I&apos;ve been a part of the A/V team at the Madeleine Parish since
          2023. I&apos;ve worked on a variety of positions, including
          livestreaming church events to YouTube. Through this, I have lots of
          experience using OBS and YouTube Studio, as well as PTZ Optics for the
          cameras. I also run A/V equipment and tech (like mixing live sound)
          when needed at both mass and church events.

          I&apos;ve been working in technical theatre since 2023 in various
          roles. At my High School, Lincoln High School, I operated spotlights
          for the 76th & 77th annual Talent Show (2024 & 2025) and later learned
          (and started leading!) set building for productions like &quot;Clue:
          On Stage&quot; (2024) (lots of fun stories about building rolling
          rooms, but that&apos;s for another time ðŸ˜…). I then used those
          building skills to design and build to set for our play festival,
          &quot;Fresh Ink&quot; (2025). For &quot;AmÃ©lie&quot; (2025), I not
          only helped build the set but also established and managed the
          projections department. This was the first time my school had ever
          attempted to use projections in a show, so I had to start from scratch
          and learn everything myself.{" "}
          <Link href="/projects/amelie">Learn more!</Link> Beyond school
          productions, I helped Portland Panto Players as the Second Sound
          Engineer for &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (2024), and completed an
          internship at Broadway Rose Theatre as a spotlight operator for
          &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (2024).

          I really enjoy working in technical theatre, lighting specifically,
          because the constrained creativity that comes with finding ways to
          convey a story (emotions, conflicts, relationships) through lighting
          is really special. In general, I love theatre and the collaborative
          aspect of working with many departments to bring a performance to
          life. I also really enjoy all the things I have learned, and continue
          to learn, through tech theatre (wiring, optics, power tools,
          carpentry, stress management, patching/routing, problem solving, etc).

          I was part of the first cohort of Replit Reps for its 4-month duration
          in 2022. During that time, I&apos; hosted live virtual events for over
          200 viewers, I hosted a hackathon, and more.

          This experience was very rewarding. I learned about what it&apos;s
          like to reach out to a fanbase and community, and I learned a lot
          about leadership, teamwork, and communication. It was also a great
          opportunity to connect with other developers and designers, which are
          connections that have helped me grow.
