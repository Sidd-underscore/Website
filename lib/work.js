          I&apos;ve been a part of the A/V team at the Madeleine Parish since
          2023. I&apos;ve worked on a variety of positions, including
          livestreaming church events to YouTube. Through this, I have lots of
          experience using OBS and YouTube Studio, as well as PTZ Optics for the
          cameras. I also run A/V equipment and tech (like mixing live sound)
          when needed at both mass and church events.

          I&apos;ve been working as a lighting and sound technician at Lincoln
          High School since 2023. I&apos;ve participated in the lighting design
          of the 76th annual Lincoln High School Talent Show
          (&quot;Popcycles&quot;) where I ran spotlights. I also operated the
          position of Second Sound Engineer for Portland Panto Players&apos;
          &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, in 2024. In the summer of that year, I
          interned at Broadway Rose Theatre as a spotlight operator for their
          performance of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, which gave me a view of
          how lighting works in professional environments.

          I really enjoy working in technical theatre, lighting specifically,
          because the constrained creativity that comes with finding ways to
          convey a story through lighting is really special. I also really enjoy
          all the things I have learned, and continue to learn, through lighting
          (electrical engineering, wiring, optics, PATCHing and routing, etc).

          I was part of the first cohort of Replit Reps for its 4-month duration
          in 2022. During that time, I&apos; hosted live virtual events for over
          200 viewers, I hosted a hackathon, and more.

          This experience was very rewarding. I learned about what it&apos;s
          like to reach out to a fanbase and community, and I learned a lot
          about leadership, teamwork, and communication. It was also a great
          opportunity to connect with other developers and designers, which are
          connections that have helped me grow.
