# Welcome, traveller!

This repo stores the code for my personal website, [sidd-underscore.vercel.app](https://sidd-underscore.vercel.app). Feel free to browse through the files if you are looking to mimic (or ~~steal~~ borrow) any components in my website! I love open source, and how it allows people to build better, together.

If you have questions, feel free to open a pull request with your question. I will arrive to your aid as quick as possible! PLEASE do the same if you have any improvements or suggestions.
